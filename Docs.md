The table of contents in the sidebar should let you easily access the documentation for your topic of interest. You can also use the search function in the top-left corner.

## Introduction

Maxwell is a young adventurer with a mission to deliver a jewel from Ubud from nargumum. There's a catch, though; every time he crosses the border of a country, his jewel power can grow strong or weak! if the jewel becomes too strong... he dies. He also has another thing to worry: his wallet. Every trip will cost him money, and the merchant doesn't care about his mission... or does he?

## Shortest path algorithm
We went for djikstra for this one

## Graphics

We've decided to use JavaFX for this game, due to its robustness and relative ease of use. We have used the Pixel Art Desert Village asset from 3dstudios (You can find the assets here: https://3dstudios.itch.io/pixel-art-desert-village) for background images. Besides that, we've made every single part of this game. Music was done by Arrais using BeepBox, and art was done by Guilherme Maximus using Photoshop.

## Conclusion

This game was a lot of fun to make. it really bonded us through chaos and disorganization, and teached a lot of valuable skills, such as graphs and the basics of game development.
